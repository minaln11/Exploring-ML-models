# Exploring-ML-models

The project involves data exploration and analysis using Pythong programming and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, scikit-learn.
The main objectives are to answer specific questions about flights from NYC to Seattle, understand delay patterns, examine seasonal patterns in departure delays, and identify the fastest flight departing from NYC in 2013. The project covers tasks like data filtering, aggregation, visualization, and statistical analysis to gain insights into the dataset.the Ship dataset is used to demonstrate the concept of cross-validation in machine learning. The project involves training and comparing two models: Linear Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The models are evaluated using cross-validation techniques to assess their performance on predicting the number of passengers based on ship characteristics like tonnage, length, cabins, and crew.
